  ### 📚 3-Point Summary


  * David Goggins was dealt a very bad hand in life. From escaping his abusive father to becoming an obese pest exterminator, *Can't Hurt Me* follows Goggins's journey on how he started with nothing and became a Navy Seal, ultramarathon runner, Guinness World Record holder, and much more.

  * The more challenges you take on, the more calloused your mind becomes. Having a calloused mind is the key to becoming uncommon. People who are uncommon lean into discomfort and exceed the expectations of everyone around them.

  * You need to take responsibility for your life. No one is coming to save you. If there is a part of your life that you don't like and can't change, you better start liking it. Carrying your excuses around only weighs you down and prevents you from achieving your full potential.


  ### 🎨 Impressions


  Reading about Goggin's life opened my eyes to how much one can withstand suffering in order to accomplish incredible feats.


  Sometimes, I would listen to the audiobook while running. Goggins would be talking about the time he fractured both shins, taped them up, and proceeded to run for hours. Meanwhile, I'd be huffing and puffing after ten minutes, but hey, at least my legs weren't broken.


  I love his no-excuses mindset and his brutal honesty. There is quite a bit of profanity in the book, which in my opinion, adds another layer of authenticity.


  Goggins didn't begin anywhere close to where he is today. His transition from being a broke, insecure kid to taking on some of the toughest challenges known to man is a long and humbling one.


  ### 🎯 Who Should Read It


  This book is for people who don't mind being called out for operating way below their potential.


  It's for those who want to widen their perspective on what's possible.


  And it's for anyone who's ever wanted to know what it takes to be uncommon amongst the uncommon.


  I would recommend listening to the audiobook because, after each chapter, there is a conversation between Goggins and his ghostwriter, Adam Skolnick. It's like an audiobook and podcast in one. Goggins shares extra stories and opinions that aren't captured in the book.


  ### 📢 Top 3 Quotes


  1. “No one is going to come help you. No one's coming to save you.”

  2. "It won’t always go your way, so you can’t get trapped in this idea that just because you’ve imagined a possibility for yourself that you somehow deserve it. Your entitled mind is dead weight. Cut it loose. Don’t focus on what you think you deserve. Take aim on what you are willing to earn!"

  3. “Our culture has become hooked on the quick-fix, the life hack, efficiency. Everyone is on the hunt for that simple action algorithm that nets maximum profit with the least amount of effort. There’s no denying this attitude may get you some of the trappings of success, if you’re lucky, but it will not lead to a calloused mind or self-mastery. If you want to master the mind and remove your governor, you’ll have to become addicted to hard work. Because passion and obsession, even talent, are only useful tools if you have the work ethic to back them up.”


  ### 🚀 Book Notes


  I don't want to spoil just how much hell David Goggins went through. Instead, here is a summary of the challenges that appear at the end of each chapter. Each challenge is similar to what Goggins does throughout the book to become superhuman.


  **Challenge 1: Bad Hand**


  In as much detail as possible, write down all of the reasons why you are not at your full potential. What cards were you dealt that make life more challenging? What do you need to overcome to become the person you want to be? What holds you back?


  It could be as simple as having been raised too comfortably and never being challenged. Your story doesn't have to be as intense as Goggins's. Everything is valid.


  Don't worry about how you'll overcome these difficulties. Just take inventory for now.


  **Challenge 2: Accountability Mirror**


  Grab some Post-It notes and write down your insecurities, dreams, and goals. Then, stick them to your mirror.


  Break your goals down into achievable steps and give each step a Post-It note. This will require some research.


  Now, when you look into the mirror call yourself out for not being the person described in your goals. If you see someone who wants to be healthy, but has never committed to any healthy habits, say it. If you see someone who is uneducated, call it out. Be as blunt as possible.


  This is one of my favourite challenges, because I believe in full accountability. Don't pat yourself on the back for doing the bare minimum every day. You have to earn what you want in life. If you don't have it, then you haven't earned it yet. No excuses.


  **Challenge 3: Impossible task**


  Write down as many uncomfortable tasks as possible. What would push you out of your comfort zone? Don't forget to consider small things like making your bed every day or taking a cold shower.


  Now go do one of those tasks as soon as possible. Then do it again the next day.


  This is about getting comfortable in the uncomfortable. Each time you can complete an uncomfortable task, your mind gets stronger and you start to believe in yourself.


  This is a time to turn your weaknesses into strengths. It's time to realize what you're capable of.


  **Challenge 4: Taking Souls**


  Taking souls is all about drawing strength from leaving people in amazement at your performance. Completely surpass everyone's expectations. Especially people who judge you.


  Choose a situation where someone is competing with or evaluating you. It could be a teacher, boss, etc.


  When given a task, do exactly what is asked and much more.


  If it's your teacher, show up to class early, study day and night, and hand in assignments that were never assigned. If it's your boss, work around the clock, hand in deliverables early, and exceed the maximum expectations.


  Make sure they witness your excellence and take pride in their surprise. Use the negativity from people who didn't believe in you and turn it into the best work they've ever seen. Take their soul.


  **Challenge 5: Armored Mind**


  Choose a goal or challenge to overcome. Visualize what success would look and feel like in as much detail as possible. Then visualize the problems that you will face along the way and how they can be dealt with.


  Visualization primes your brain for doing the activity. But don't be fooled. It's not magic. You still need to put in work, pain and suffering every day to get there. Using visualization affirms that the work you put in will pay off.


  **Challenge 6: Cookie Jar**


  The cookie jar is an analogy Goggins uses for the list of hurdles one has overcome throughout their life. Write down all of your successes and recall the feeling of overcoming them. These memories are a reminder of who you are and what you're capable of.


  Now take on an ambitious goal. Aim for a new personal record in the gym or try to study more consistently than ever before. With any task, the pain or boredom will hit you eventually and when that happens, reach your hand into the cookie jar and remind yourself that you are a badass.


  **Challenge 7: The 40% Rule**


  Choose a physical activity and try to increase your workload by 5 to 10 percent each week. For example, if you're used to doing 20 push-ups in a workout, do 22 the next time.


  The gradual progression will allow your body and mind to adapt. It will help you to break past what you previously thought was your limit.


  This is more of a mental challenge than a physical one. You are learning to control your inner dialogue. Shut out thoughts that tell you to avoid pain and lean into the ones that tell you to get it done.


  By overcoming physical challenges, this work ethic will transfer into other aspects of your life as well.


  **Challenge 8: Talent not Required**


  Talent is useful, but it's nothing without work.


  This challenge is about organizing your schedule into focused blocks of time to accomplish what you want.


  In week one, record what you're doing in as much detail as possible. If you're on your phone or laptop, what apps are you using? What are you actually spending your time on at work?


  In week two, look at your previous schedule and reorganize it. Block off activities in 15 or 30-minute chunks of time. Some activities will take up multiple blocks. Ensure that you schedule in time for eating and resting.


  Now, when it is time to do a scheduled activity, focus on that one thing. When that time is over, be disciplined enough to stop what you're doing and move on to the next task.


  Make adjustments to your week two schedule as needed. By week three you should have a proficient schedule that maximizes your effort without sacrificing sleep.


  **Challenge 9:** **Uncommon Amongst Uncommon**


  If you want to be uncommon amongst uncommon, you can't get complacent. Wherever you are now, do what it takes to stand out. Especially if you are surrounded by top performers.


  It's not enough to get into a great school. The uncommon graduate at the top of their class. Goggins didn't just become a Navy Seal. He is also an Enlisted Honor Man in Army Ranger School, an ultra-marathon runner, among other badass titles.


  > Continue to put obstacles in front of yourself, because that's where you'll find the friction that will help you to grow even stronger. -David Goggins


  **Challenge 10: Empowerment of Failure**


  Write down some of your greatest failures. What went well? How did you handle failing? Recall the preparation process and your thoughts as you were executing the activity.


  Going back, make a detailed list of what you can fix. Be brutally honest with yourself.


  Now, schedule another attempt immediately. If you fail again, so be it. Try again. That's what life's about.


  If the activity is something that cannot be recreated, ensure that you still record what you can fix. These notes will still help you to achieve future goals.
